== TOE Overview
=== TOE main security features
This is a collaborative Protection Profile Module (PP-Module) used to extend a Base-PP for a computer that implements biometric enrolment and verification to unlock the computer in the locked state using the user’s biometric characteristics. Therefore, the Target of Evaluation (TOE) in this PP-Module is a computer that implements biometric enrolment and verification functionality. However, the terms TOE and TOE environment in this document expresses the biometric system that implements the biometric enrolment and verification functionality, and the computer that supports the biometric system to protect the biometric data respectively, for clearly describing the relation and boundary between the biometric system and computer. The biometric enrolment and verification processes are described in the following sections. 

==== CMFA Enrolment

During the enrolment process, the TOE captures samples from the biometric characteristics of a user presented to the TOE and extracts the features from the samples. The features are then stored as a template in the TOE.

Only a user who knows the computer NBAF can enrol or revoke one's own templates. Multiple templates may be enroled, as separate entries uniquely identified by the TOE, and optionally uniquely identifiable by the user (through the computer's User Interface).

==== CMFA Verification

During the verification process, a user presents one's own biometric characteristics to the TOE without presenting any user identity information for unlocking the computer. The TOE captures samples from the biometric characteristics, retrieves all enroled templates and compares them with the features extracted from the captured samples of the user to measure the similarity between the two data and determines whether to accept or reject the user based on the similarity, and indicates the decision to the computer.

Examples of biometric characteristic used for the biometric enrolment and verification are: fingerprint, face, eye, palm print, finger vein, palm vein, speech, signature and so forth. However, scope of this PP-Module is limited to only those biometric characteristics that can be selected from FIA_MBV_EXT.1.1 for which <<BIOSD>> defines the Evaluation Activities.

=== CMFA Management


=== TOE Design
The TOE is fully integrated into the computer without the need for additional software and hardware. The following figure, inspired from <<ISO/IEC 30107-1>>, is a generic representation of a TOE. It should be noted that the actual TOE design may not directly correspond to this figure and the developer may design the TOE in a different way. This illustrates the different sub-functionalities on which the biometric enrolment and verification processes rely on.

As illustrated in the above figure, the TOE is capable of:

* Capturing samples from user’s biometric characteristics (Data Capture Subsystem)
* Extracting and processing the features from samples of sufficient quality and generating various templates (Signal Processing Subsystem)
* Storing the templates in a database on the computer (Storage Subsystem)
* Comparing captured features with data contained in one or more templates (Comparison Subsystem)
* Deciding how well features and any template match, and indicating whether or not a verification of the user has been achieved (Decision Subsystem)
* Optionally detecting the presentation attacks using an artefact (Presentation attack detection subsystem)

==== Relation between TOE and Computer 
The TOE is reliant on the computer itself to provide overall security of the system. This PP-Module is intended to be used with a Base-PP, and the Base-PP is responsible for evaluating the following security functions:

* Providing the NBAF to support user authentication and management of the TOE security function
* Invoking the TOE to enrol and verify the user and take appropriate actions based on the decision of the TOE
* Providing the Separate Execution Environment (SEE) that guarantees the TOE and its data to be protected with respect to confidentiality and integrity

The specification of the above security  functions are described in the Base-PP and <<PP_MDF Security Functional Requirements Direction>> of this PP-Module.

==== TOE Use Case
The computer itself may be operated in a number of use cases such as enterprise use with limited personal use or Bring Your Own Device (BYOD). The TOE on the computer may also be operated in the same use cases, however, use cases of the TOE should be devised separately considering the purpose of biometric verification. The following use cases describe how and why biometric verification is supposed to be used. Each use case has its own assurance level, depending on its criticality and separate PP or PP-Module should be developed for each use case.  

This PP-Module only assumes USE CASE 1 described below. USE CASE 2 is out of scope of this PP-Module.

===== USE CASE 1: CMFA verification for unlocking the computer
This use case is applicable for any computers such as a desktop, laptop, tablet or smartphone that implement biometric enrolment and verification functionality. For enhanced security that is easy to use, the computer may implement biometric verification on a computer once it has been “unlocked”. The initial unlock is generally done by a NBAF which is required at startup (or possibly after some period of time), and after that, the user is able to use one's own biometric characteristic to unlock access to the computer. In this use case, the computer is not supposed to be used for security sensitive services through the biometric verification.

The main concern of this use case is the accuracy of the biometric verification (i.e. FAR/FMR and FRR/FNMR). Security assurance for computer that the TOE relies on should be handled by the Base-PP.

This use case assumes that the computer is configured correctly to enable the biometric verification by the user, who acts as the biometric system administrator in this use case.

It is also assumed that the user enrols to the biometric system correctly, following the guidance provided by the TOE. Presentation attacks during biometric enrolment and verification may be out of scope, but optionally addressed. FTE is not a security relevant criterion for this use case.

===== USE CASE 2: CMFA verification for security sensitive service

This use case is an example of another use case that is not considered in this PP-Module. Another PP or PP-Module should be developed at higher assurance level for this use case.

Computers may be used for security sensitive services such as payment transactions and online banking. Verification may be done by the biometric for convenience instead of the NBAF to access such security sensitive services.

The requirements for the TOE focus on the biometric performance (FTE, FAR/FMR and FRR/FNMR) and presentation attack detection.


== Security Functional Requirements

=== Conventions
The individual security functional requirements are specified in the sections below.
The following conventions are used for the completion of operations:

* [_Italicized text within square brackets_] indicates an operation to be completed by the ST author.

* [*Bold text within square brackets*] indicates the type of operation.

Extended SFRs are identified by having a label “EXT” at the end of the SFR name.

=== PP_MDF Security Functional Requirements Direction

In a PP-Configuration that includes the <<PP_MDF>>, the biometric enrolment and verification is expected to rely on some of the security functions implemented by the computer as a whole and evaluated against the Base-PP. In this case, the following sections describe any modifications that the ST author must make to the SFRs defined in the Base-PP in addition to what is mandated by <<TOE Security Functional Requirements>>. 

Full evaluation activities are not repeated in the <<BIOSD>> for the requirements in this section that are references to the <<PP_MDF>>; only the additional testing needed to supplement what has already been captured in the <<PP_MDF>> is included in the <<BIOSD>>

==== Modified SFRs

The SFRs listed in this section are defined in the <<PP_MDF>> and relevant to the secure operation of the biometric enrolment and verification. It is necessary for the ST author to complete selections and/or assignments for these SFRs in a specific manner in order to ensure that the functionality provided by the mobile device is consistent with the functionality required by the biometric enrolment and verification in order for it to conform to this PP-Module.

===== Class: Cryptographic Support (FCS)
This PP-Module does not modify SFRs in FCS class as it is defined in the <<PP_MDF>>. However, note that BAF must be illustrated in the key hierarchy diagram and all keys created upon successful biometric enrolment and verification must be generated, derived, combined, released and destroyed according to SFRs in this class.

===== FCS_CKM_EXT.4 Key Destruction [[FCS_CKM_EXT.4]]
This SFR is identical to what is defined in the <<PP_MDF>>. The change is to the application note.

*Application Note:* For the purposes of this requirement, plaintext keying material refers to authentication data, passwords, secret/private symmetric keys, private asymmetric keys, data used to derive keys, values derived from passwords, etc. *Biometric data used for enrolment or verification are considered critical security parameters that must be destroyed when no longer needed.*

*Application Note {counter:remark_count}*:: The Application Note following FCS_CKM_EXT.4.2 is modified to add the text to include biometric data as a critical security parameter to ensure it is handled properly by the TSF.

===== FPT_AEX_EXT.4 Domain Isolation [[FPT_AEX_EXT.4]]
This SFR is identical to what is defined in the <<PP_MDF>>. The change is to the application note.

*Application Note:* In addition to the TSF software (e.g., kernel image, device drivers, trusted applications) that resides in storage, the execution context (e.g., address space, processor registers, per-process environment variables) of the software operating in a privileged mode of the processor (e.g., kernel, *other processor modes*) *or on separate processors*, as well as the context of the trusted applications is to be protected. In addition to the software, any configuration information that controls or influences the behavior of the TSF *and any hardware (e.g. biometric capture sensor) that generates or accesses the biometric data* is also to be protected from modification *or unauthorized access* by untrusted subjects.

*Application Note {counter:remark_count}*:: This application note explicitly adds more support for additional processor modes (e.g. the Secure/Normal World modes defined in a Trusted Execution Environment) or separate processors (e.g. a secure element) that may be present and used for the processing of biometric data. Any biometric components depicted in <<Figure 1>> should be considered as TSF being protected by these mechanisms, defined as the SEE.

===== FPT_KST_EXT.1 Key Storage [[FPT_KST_EXT.1]]

*FPT_KST_EXT.1.1*:: The TSF shall not store any plaintext key material *or biometric data* in readable non-volatile memory.

*Application Note {counter:remark_count}*:: This SFR is functionally identical to what is defined in the <<PP_MDF>> with the addition of biometric data as key materials to be protected. Plaintext biometric data to be protected includes any data used for the biometric enrolment and verification.

===== FPT_KST_EXT.2 No Key Transmission [[FPT_KST_EXT.2]]

*FPT_KST_EXT.2.1*:: The TSF shall not transmit any plaintext key material *or biometric data* outside the security boundary of the TOE.

*Application Note {counter:remark_count}*:: This SFR is functionally identical to what is defined in the <<PP_MDF>> with the addition of biometric data as plaintext key materials that must not be transmitted off-device. 

==== Additional SFRs

There are no additional SFRs that must be claimed only in cases where the <<PP_MDF>> is the claimed Base-PP.
