== TOE Overview
=== TOE main security features

* enrolment
* verification
* updating the system based on new parameters
** for example geolocation tags when traveling to another office
* biometric update (later training period), after injury, other changes
* admin configuration
* user-authorized update (require password/PIN before allowing for user-requested change), configured by admin (allow/disallow)


This is a collaborative Protection Profile Module (PP-Module) used to extend a Base-PP for a computer that implements CMFA to keep the computer in the unlocked state using a collection of CMFA inputs. Therefore, the Target of Evaluation (TOE) in this PP-Module is a computer that implements CMFA functionality. However, the terms TOE and TOE environment in this document expresses the CMFA system that implements the continuous authentication functionality, and the computer that supports the CMFA system to protect the CMFA data respectively, for clearly describing the relation and boundary between the CMFA system and computer. The CMFA enrolment and verification processes are described in the following sections. 

==== CMFA Enrolment
*Claire*

During the enrolment process, the TOE captures samples from the biometric characteristics of a user presented to the TOE and extracts the features from the samples. The features are then stored as a template in the TOE.

Only a user who knows the computer NBAF can enrol or revoke one's own templates. Multiple templates may be enroled, as separate entries uniquely identified by the TOE, and optionally uniquely identifiable by the user (through the computer's User Interface).

==== CMFA Verification

Continuous verification in the context of CMFA is a passive activity from the user's perspective.  No overt authentication related action is required by the user to determine CMFA status.  From the user's perspective, he/she is merely using the computer for its intended purposes.  During the verification process, a user's CMFA verification input signals are periodically sampled by the CMFA TOE.  The user is not prompted to provide any of these input signals.  The TOE collects these data as needed from the computer/sensors whether or not the user is interacting with the computer.  Each CMFA input signal is individually tested for quality and veracity according to each signal's defined standards as prescribed by the TOE vendor and selected by the CMFA Administrator.  The CMFA engine calculates a score based on all available input data that meets prescribed data quality and veracity metrics to determine a Trust score.  If the Trust score meets or exceeds the CMFA threshold for that particular use case, the computer remains unlocked.  If the CMFA Trust score falls below the threshold, the TOE informs the computer the CMFA threshold is not met and the computer determines if the computer should be remain unlocked.  Once the computer is locked the user is required to re-authenticate to the computer to unlock the device in accordance with [reference the appropriate PP requirement].

CMFA related signals include all the input signals available to the TOE as defined by the TOE vendor.  Some or all available CMFA signals may be selected by the CMFA administrator for use in calculating the Trust score for a given use case.  Data provided by these signals can include user biometric information, wireless signal information (BT, Wi-Fi, NFC, etc.), location, on body status, local time, various computer status information, information from external devices such as wearables that are paired with the computer, and others.  CMFA signal selection may be static or dynamic.  Static selections are made by the CMFA administrator and remain fixed until changed by the administrator.  Dynamic selections are set by the administrator but can change according to changes in the computer status such as time of day, location, wireless signal strength, connected network ID, user request for change, etc.  Limits on what is permitted to change and by how much are set by the administrator.

=== CMFA Management
*Brian*

* general configuration (not specific to 1 user)
* choice of inputs
* configure details for inputs (i.e. specific Wi-Fi network, not any Wi-Fi network)
* parameter combinations necessary for score
** location + time + Wi-Fi = good, vs just checking general parameters
* concept of scoring/trust
* ability to configure based on specific needs (flexible system)

=== CMFA User Auth Update
* updating the user template, by either admin directly or some sort of user-requested authorization
* management functions that are specific to a single user

=== TOE Design
The TOE is fully integrated into the computer without the need for additional software and hardware. The following figure, inspired from <<ISO/IEC 30107-1>>, is a generic representation of a TOE. It should be noted that the actual TOE design may not directly correspond to this figure and the developer may design the TOE in a different way. This illustrates the different sub-functionalities on which the biometric enrolment and verification processes rely on.

As illustrated in the above figure, the TOE is capable of:

* Capturing samples from user's biometric characteristics (Data Capture Subsystem)
* Extracting and processing the features from samples of sufficient quality and generating various templates (Signal Processing Subsystem)
* Storing the templates in a database on the computer (Storage Subsystem)
* Comparing captured features with data contained in one or more templates (Comparison Subsystem)
* Deciding how well features and any template match, and indicating whether or not a verification of the user has been achieved (Decision Subsystem)
* Optionally detecting the presentation attacks using an artefact (Presentation attack detection subsystem)

==== Relation between TOE and Computer 
The TOE is reliant on the computer itself to provide overall security of the system. This PP-Module is intended to be used with a Base-PP, and the Base-PP is responsible for evaluating the following security functions:

* Providing the NBAF to support user authentication and management of the TOE security function
* Invoking the TOE to enrol and verify the user and take appropriate actions based on the decision of the TOE
* Providing the Separate Execution Environment (SEE) that guarantees the TOE and its data to be protected with respect to confidentiality and integrity

The specification of the above security  functions are described in the Base-PP and <<PP_MDF Security Functional Requirements Direction>> of this PP-Module.

==== TOE Use Case
The computer itself may be operated in a number of use cases such as enterprise use with limited personal use or Bring Your Own Device (BYOD). The TOE on the computer may also be operated in the same use cases, however, use cases of the TOE should be devised separately considering the purpose of biometric verification. The following use cases describe how and why biometric verification is supposed to be used. Each use case has its own assurance level, depending on its criticality and separate PP or PP-Module should be developed for each use case.  

This PP-Module only assumes USE CASE 1 described below. USE CASE 2 is out of scope of this PP-Module.

===== USE CASE 1: CMFA verification for maintaining the unlocked state on the computer
This use case is applicable for any computers such as a desktop, laptop, tablet or smartphone that implement biometric enrolment and verification functionality. For enhanced security that is easy to use, the computer may implement biometric verification on a computer once it has been “unlocked”. The initial unlock is generally done by a NBAF which is required at startup (or possibly after some period of time), and after that, the user is able to use one's own biometric characteristic to unlock access to the computer. In this use case, the computer is not supposed to be used for security sensitive services through the biometric verification.

The main concern of this use case is the accuracy of the biometric verification (i.e. FAR/FMR and FRR/FNMR). Security assurance for computer that the TOE relies on should be handled by the Base-PP.

This use case assumes that the computer is configured correctly to enable the biometric verification by the user, who acts as the biometric system administrator in this use case.

It is also assumed that the user enrols to the biometric system correctly, following the guidance provided by the TOE. Presentation attacks during biometric enrolment and verification may be out of scope, but optionally addressed. FTE is not a security relevant criterion for this use case.

===== USE CASE 2: CMFA verification for security sensitive service

This use case is an example of another use case that is not considered in this PP-Module. Another PP or PP-Module should be developed at higher assurance level for this use case.

Computers may be used for security sensitive services such as payment transactions and online banking. Verification may be done by the biometric for convenience instead of the NBAF to access such security sensitive services.

The requirements for the TOE focus on the biometric performance (FTE, FAR/FMR and FRR/FNMR) and presentation attack detection.

===== USE CASE 3: CMFA verification used to unlock external services
* for example using the score data to authorize unlocking a door


== Security Functional Requirements

=== Conventions
The individual security functional requirements are specified in the sections below.
The following conventions are used for the completion of operations:

* [_Italicized text within square brackets_] indicates an operation to be completed by the ST author.

* [*Bold text within square brackets*] indicates the type of operation.

Extended SFRs are identified by having a label “EXT” at the end of the SFR name.

=== PP_MDF Security Functional Requirements Direction

In a PP-Configuration that includes the <<PP_MDF>>, the biometric enrolment and verification is expected to rely on some of the security functions implemented by the computer as a whole and evaluated against the Base-PP. In this case, the following sections describe any modifications that the ST author must make to the SFRs defined in the Base-PP in addition to what is mandated by <<TOE Security Functional Requirements>>. 

Full evaluation activities are not repeated in the <<BIOSD>> for the requirements in this section that are references to the <<PP_MDF>>; only the additional testing needed to supplement what has already been captured in the <<PP_MDF>> is included in the <<BIOSD>>

==== Modified SFRs

The SFRs listed in this section are defined in the <<PP_MDF>> and relevant to the secure operation of the biometric enrolment and verification. It is necessary for the ST author to complete selections and/or assignments for these SFRs in a specific manner in order to ensure that the functionality provided by the mobile device is consistent with the functionality required by the biometric enrolment and verification in order for it to conform to this PP-Module.

===== Class: Cryptographic Support (FCS)
This PP-Module does not modify SFRs in FCS class as it is defined in the <<PP_MDF>>. However, note that BAF must be illustrated in the key hierarchy diagram and all keys created upon successful biometric enrolment and verification must be generated, derived, combined, released and destroyed according to SFRs in this class.

===== FCS_CKM_EXT.4 Key Destruction [[FCS_CKM_EXT.4]]
This SFR is identical to what is defined in the <<PP_MDF>>. The change is to the application note.

*Application Note:* For the purposes of this requirement, plaintext keying material refers to authentication data, passwords, secret/private symmetric keys, private asymmetric keys, data used to derive keys, values derived from passwords, etc. *Biometric data used for enrolment or verification are considered critical security parameters that must be destroyed when no longer needed.*

*Application Note {counter:remark_count}*:: The Application Note following FCS_CKM_EXT.4.2 is modified to add the text to include biometric data as a critical security parameter to ensure it is handled properly by the TSF.

===== FPT_AEX_EXT.4 Domain Isolation [[FPT_AEX_EXT.4]]
This SFR is identical to what is defined in the <<PP_MDF>>. The change is to the application note.

*Application Note:* In addition to the TSF software (e.g., kernel image, device drivers, trusted applications) that resides in storage, the execution context (e.g., address space, processor registers, per-process environment variables) of the software operating in a privileged mode of the processor (e.g., kernel, *other processor modes*) *or on separate processors*, as well as the context of the trusted applications is to be protected. In addition to the software, any configuration information that controls or influences the behavior of the TSF *and any hardware (e.g. biometric capture sensor) that generates or accesses the biometric data* is also to be protected from modification *or unauthorized access* by untrusted subjects.

*Application Note {counter:remark_count}*:: This application note explicitly adds more support for additional processor modes (e.g. the Secure/Normal World modes defined in a Trusted Execution Environment) or separate processors (e.g. a secure element) that may be present and used for the processing of biometric data. Any biometric components depicted in <<Figure 1>> should be considered as TSF being protected by these mechanisms, defined as the SEE.

===== FPT_KST_EXT.1 Key Storage [[FPT_KST_EXT.1]]

*FPT_KST_EXT.1.1*:: The TSF shall not store any plaintext key material *or biometric data* in readable non-volatile memory.

*Application Note {counter:remark_count}*:: This SFR is functionally identical to what is defined in the <<PP_MDF>> with the addition of biometric data as key materials to be protected. Plaintext biometric data to be protected includes any data used for the biometric enrolment and verification.

===== FPT_KST_EXT.2 No Key Transmission [[FPT_KST_EXT.2]]

*FPT_KST_EXT.2.1*:: The TSF shall not transmit any plaintext key material *or biometric data* outside the security boundary of the TOE.

*Application Note {counter:remark_count}*:: This SFR is functionally identical to what is defined in the <<PP_MDF>> with the addition of biometric data as plaintext key materials that must not be transmitted off-device. 

==== Additional SFRs

There are no additional SFRs that must be claimed only in cases where the <<PP_MDF>> is the claimed Base-PP.

=== TOE Security Functional Requirements
This section lists SFRs for the biometric enrolment and verification.

==== Cryptopgraphic Operations (FCS)
* consider what base-PP SFRs may be mandatory for functionality
* see if anything not covered in base-PP is needed

==== User Data Protection (FDP)

* Access control policy/functions
* information flow control/functions

== Optional Requirements
This section comprises requirements that can be included in the ST, but are not mandatory for a TOE to claim conformance to this PP-Module.

ST authors are free to choose none, some or all SFRs defined in this Section. Just the fact that a product supports a certain functionality does not mandate to add any SFR defined in this chapter.
